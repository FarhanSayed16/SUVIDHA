## Quick Summary

SUVIDHA replaces fragmented civic office workflows with **one digital helpdesk** where citizens can:

- Pay bills (Electricity, Gas, Water)
- Register and track complaints
- Apply for new connections and service requests
- Access advisories and emergency alerts
- Use the system in their language with accessibility support

The system is built as **microservices**, with a **touch kiosk UI** and an **admin dashboard** for analytics and governance.
